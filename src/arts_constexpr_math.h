 * \brief  Simple constexpr math that we can make use of in Arts
 *
 * The main advantage of maning things like here is to avoid repetition
 * later x*x*x*x is more difficult than pow4(x).
 * 
 * The main point of these functions is to avoid repetition as above in
 * context where we also want to support compile time computations
